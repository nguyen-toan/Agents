Multi-agent systems (MAS) are no longer just a theoretical concept; they're a powerful paradigm offering tangible benefits to software developers looking to innovate and streamline their workflow.\n\nOne of the most significant advantages of MAS is **enhanced modularity and maintainability**. Imagine breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, manageable, and independently deployable agents. This means you can update, debug, and scale individual components without fear of impacting the entire system. This also fosters better team collaboration, with specialized agents handling specific functionalities, making development clearer and more efficient.\n\nFurthermore, MAS significantly boosts **robustness and fault tolerance**. By designing systems where agents can operate even if others fail, thanks to redundancy and distributed decision-making, you create more resilient applications. Agents can adapt to changing environments and dynamically reconfigure, minimizing single points of failure and ensuring your software keeps running smoothly.\n\nThe power of MAS extends to **problem-solving and optimization**. The collective intelligence of multiple agents can tackle complex challenges that a single entity simply couldn't. These agents can learn from each other, optimizing their behavior over time for more efficient solutions, and facilitating parallel processing for faster development cycles and better resource utilization.\n\nFinally, MAS enables the creation of truly **adaptive and intelligent systems**. You can build software that learns, reasons, and adapts to user needs and evolving environments in real-time, opening doors to sophisticated simulations and cutting-edge AI-driven applications.\n\nMulti-agent systems represent a significant evolution in software architecture.

Generative AI is poised to inject trillions into the global economy through enhanced content creation and customer operations, with major players like Microsoft and Google heavily invested. Agentic AI, capable of autonomous decision-making and complex task execution, is rapidly advancing, promising significant efficiency gains and a shift in human work towards higher-level responsibilities. This surge in AI necessitates a strong focus on explainable and ethical AI to ensure trust, regulatory compliance, and responsible deployment, particularly in sensitive sectors.\n\nIn healthcare, AI is augmenting traditional breakthroughs like gene therapy and CAR T-cell treatments, which are offering new hope for genetic disorders and brain cancer, with widespread adoption expected within 1-5 years. AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as skin cancer detection systems, are emerging alongside novel therapeutic approaches like AI-designed bacteria-killing viruses, which could revolutionize drug manufacturing but also spark ethical debates.\n\nFinancially, AI and machine learning are transforming the sector through real-time risk assessment and personalized services. This innovation is coupled with the growth of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), enhancing security and reducing costs. Despite geopolitical tensions like the US-China \"AI Cold War,\" global financial cooperation and the expansion of digital asset banking services are progressing, indicating a dynamic and technologically driven future.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"🎉 Great! You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-13T05:52:00.154880Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-13T05:52:00.157779Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-13T05:52:00.172794Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-13T05:52:00.157742Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-13T05:52:00.171562Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

For twenty years, this isolated tower had been his world. One storm-lashed evening, a sodden, rolled-up parchment washed ashore. Unfurling it in the lantern's glow, Silas gasped. It wasn't paper, but a strange, leathery material that pulsed with an inner, emerald light.

The pacing is effective for a short piece, quickly establishing Silas's solitary existence and then introducing the inciting incident with the map.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Deepen Silas's Reaction:** While Silas \"gasped\" and felt a \"tremor,\" his twenty years of isolation could lend themselves to a more profound emotional or psychological reaction to such an extraordinary discovery. Consider showing his disbelief, fear, or even a flicker of long-dormant hope. What specific thoughts run through his mind beyond the realization that the map isn't of this world?\n2.  **Enhance Sensory Details of the Map:** The description of the map is good (\"leathery material,\" \"emerald light,\" \"glowing lines\"), but adding one more unique sensory detail could make it even more memorable. For instance, does it emit a faint hum, a subtle warmth, or a scent unlike anything Silas has encountered?\n3.  **Hint at the Map's Purpose/Origin:** The story ends with the revelation that the map is otherworldly. For a slightly more complete feel, you could add a very subtle hint about *why* it might have washed ashore or what its ultimate purpose could be. This could be a single word or symbol on the map that Silas recognizes as being associated with a myth, or a brief, fleeting image that flashes across its surface.\nRefinerAgent > The salt spray was Silas’s constant companion, kissing his weathered cheeks as he tended the lamp. For twenty years, this isolated tower had been his solitary world, a place where the rhythmic crash of waves and the lonely cry of gulls were his only conversations. One storm-lashed evening, as rain lashed against the glass and the wind howled like a banshee, a sodden, rolled-up object tumbled ashore. Intrigued, Silas descended the winding stairs and ventured out, his oilskin coat clutched tight.\n\nHe retrieved the object, expecting driftwood or perhaps a message in a bottle. Back in the lantern’s warm glow, he unfurled it. Silas gasped, a sound swallowed by the storm. It wasn't paper, nor parchment, but a strange, supple material that felt unnervingly like cured hide, yet it pulsed with an inner, emerald light. Intricate, glowing lines traced across its surface, depicting constellations utterly alien and currents that defied any known charts. A faint, almost inaudible hum emanated from it, a silent song that vibrated in his very bones. As he stared, a single, radiant 'X' at its center pulsed like a heartbeat, and for a fleeting second, he saw a swirl of nebulae, a cosmic dance he’d only ever glimpsed in his most fervent, forgotten dreams.\n\nThe map, he realized with a tremor that had nothing to do with the storm, wasn't of this world. His mind, long dulled by routine, reeled. Was this a jest? A hallucination brought on by solitude? Yet, the faint warmth radiating from the leathery surface and the insistent, otherworldly glow were undeniable. He traced a finger over a cluster of alien stars. His breath hitched. Beneath the alien script, barely visible, was a symbol he’d once seen in a tattered book of myths long ago – the mark of the Star-Sailors, whispered to be beings who navigated the void between worlds. The map wasn't just from another world; it was a key, a beckoning call from the cosmic unknown, delivered by the indifferent sea to his lonely tower. A terrifying, exhilarating hope, dormant for two decades, flickered to life in his chest.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

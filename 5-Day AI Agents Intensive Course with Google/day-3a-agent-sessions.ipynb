AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Genomic and Multi-omics Analysis:** AI algorithms are becoming more adept at sifting through massive datasets from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to identify novel biological targets (genes, proteins) that are implicated in diseases. This allows researchers to move beyond well-understood targets and explore new therapeutic avenues.\n*   **Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:** AI can model complex biological networks and pathways to understand how different molecules interact. This helps in identifying key nodes or disruptions that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention.\n*   **Literature Mining and Knowledge Graphs:** Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) can scan millions of scientific publications to extract relevant information, identify emerging trends, and build knowledge graphs that connect genes, diseases, drugs, and biological processes, revealing hidden relationships.\n\n**2. Accelerated Molecule Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** Generative AI models (like Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, and Variational Autoencoders - VAEs) are being used to design entirely new drug molecules from scratch, rather than just modifying existing ones. These models can learn the properties of effective drugs and generate novel structures with desired characteristics (e.g., binding affinity, solubility, reduced toxicity).\n*   **Predictive Modeling of Drug Properties:** AI can accurately predict various drug properties, including:\n    *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly a drug molecule will bind to its target.\n    *   **ADMET Properties:** Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity. This helps filter out molecules likely to fail later in development due to poor pharmacokinetic profiles or toxicity.\n    *   **Off-Target Effects:** Predicting potential interactions with unintended targets, which can cause side effects.\n*   **Fragment-Based Drug Design (FBDD) Enhancement:** AI can analyze how small molecular fragments bind to targets and guide the assembly of these fragments into larger, more potent drug candidates.\n\n**3. Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Design and Execution:**\n\n*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can analyze patient data to identify subgroups who are more likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more targeted and efficient clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting Trial Success:** AI models can analyze historical clinical trial data to identify factors that contribute to success or failure, helping to optimize trial design and reduce the risk of costly failures.\n*   **Virtual Trials and Digital Twins:** While still in early stages, there's research into using AI to create \"digital twins\" of patients or populations to simulate drug responses and potentially reduce the need for some in-person trials.\n*   **Real-World Evidence (RWE) Integration:** AI can analyze RWE from sources like EHRs and wearables to monitor drug effectiveness and safety in real-world settings, providing valuable insights post-approval.\n\n**4. Emerging Technologies and Platforms:**\n\n*   **Boolean Search and Semantic Search:** While not strictly \"new,\" these are being continuously refined to help researchers find the right information faster.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Molecule Optimization:** RL can be used to \"train\" AI agents to iteratively refine drug molecules to achieve specific objectives, mimicking an expert chemist's iterative process.\n*   **Quantum Computing for Drug Discovery:** While still largely in the research phase, quantum computing holds the promise of simulating molecular interactions with unprecedented accuracy, which could revolutionize drug discovery by solving complex quantum mechanical problems that are intractable for classical computers.\n\n**Examples of recent trends and news:**\n\n*   **Increased funding and acquisitions:** Venture capital continues to pour into AI-driven drug discovery companies, and larger pharmaceutical companies are actively acquiring or partnering with these AI specialists.\n*   **Positive clinical trial results:** Several companies are reporting promising early-stage clinical trial results for drugs discovered or optimized using AI.\n*   **Focus on specific disease areas:** AI is being applied to a wide range of diseases, from oncology and rare diseases to infectious diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.\n*   **Ethical considerations and data integrity:** As AI becomes more integrated, there's a growing focus on ensuring the ethical use of data, mitigating bias in AI models, and maintaining the integrity of scientific findings.\n\nIn essence, AI is not just a tool for drug discovery; it's becoming an integral part of the entire pipeline, from hypothesis generation to clinical development. The pace of innovation is rapid, and we can expect to see even more groundbreaking discoveries and therapies emerge in the coming years thanks to these advancements.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **Accelerated Molecule Design and Optimization.** This is a really exciting area because it directly tackles the challenge of finding the right chemical structures that can become effective drugs.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what that entails:\n\n**The Core Problem:**\n\nImagine trying to find a specific key that fits a very complex lock. In drug discovery, the \"lock\" is a biological target (like a protein on a cancer cell), and the \"key\" is a drug molecule that can bind to it and affect its function. There are an almost infinite number of possible molecular structures. Traditional drug discovery often involves a lot of trial-and-error, screening millions of existing compounds or making educated guesses based on known structures. This is time-consuming, expensive, and often inefficient.\n\n**How AI Accelerates This:**\n\nAI, particularly **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)**, is revolutionizing this process by:\n\n1.  **De Novo Drug Design (Designing \"From Scratch\"):**\n    *   **What it is:** Instead of just modifying existing drugs, AI models can be trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. They then learn the fundamental \"rules\" of molecular structure and how these rules relate to desired biological activity. Once trained, these models can *generate* completely new molecular structures that have never been synthesized before.\n    *   **Key AI Techniques:**\n        *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks: a \"generator\" that creates new molecules and a \"discriminator\" that tries to distinguish between real and AI-generated molecules. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to create increasingly realistic and promising molecular candidates.\n        *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (latent space) of molecular structures and can then decode this representation to generate new variations or entirely novel molecules.\n        *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be used to guide the generation process. The AI agent is rewarded for creating molecules that possess specific desirable properties (e.g., high binding affinity to the target, low toxicity).\n    *   **Why it's a game-changer:** It opens up a much larger chemical space for exploration, potentially leading to entirely new classes of drugs that wouldn't have been conceived through traditional methods.\n\n2.  **Predictive Modeling of Drug Properties:**\n    *   **What it is:** Even when designing molecules, you need to know if they're likely to *work*. AI models can predict a wide range of crucial properties of a potential drug molecule before it's even synthesized or tested in a lab.\n    *   **Key Properties Predicted:**\n        *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly the molecule will attach to its intended biological target. Higher affinity often means a more potent drug.\n        *   **ADMET Properties:** This is a critical set of factors that determine how a drug behaves in the body:\n            *   **Absorption:** How well it gets into the bloodstream.\n            *   **Distribution:** Where it goes in the body.\n            *   **Metabolism:** How it's broken down.\n            *   **Excretion:** How it's removed from the body.\n            *   **Toxicity:** Whether it's harmful to cells or organs.\n        *   **Off-Target Effects:** Predicting if the molecule might bind to other proteins or receptors in the body, leading to unwanted side effects.\n        *   **Solubility and Stability:** Essential for formulation and shelf-life.\n    *   **Key AI Techniques:**\n        *   **Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) and Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR):** These are ML models that learn the relationship between a molecule's chemical structure and its biological activity or physical properties.\n        *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** These are particularly well-suited for analyzing molecular structures, which can be represented as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.\n    *   **Why it's a game-changer:** By accurately predicting these properties early on, researchers can filter out weak or toxic candidates much sooner, saving immense time and resources. It significantly increases the probability of success for molecules that advance through the development pipeline.\n\n3.  **Optimization of Existing Leads:**\n    *   **What it is:** Once a promising \"lead\" compound is identified (a molecule that shows some desired activity), AI can help chemists systematically optimize its structure to improve its potency, reduce toxicity, and enhance its ADMET properties.\n    *   **How it works:** AI models can suggest specific modifications to the lead molecule, such as adding or removing functional groups, changing the arrangement of atoms, etc., and predict the impact of these changes on the desired properties. This is often an iterative process.\n\n**In summary, the development in accelerated molecule design and optimization is about using AI to:**\n\n*   **Explore a vaster chemical universe** to find novel drug candidates.\n*   **Predict the behavior and efficacy** of these candidates with much higher accuracy and speed.\n*   **Systematically improve promising molecules** to make them viable drug products.\n\nThis leads to faster identification of promising drug candidates, reduced failure rates in later stages of development, and ultimately, the potential to bring life-saving medicines to patients more quickly and efficiently.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven drug discovery, particularly in molecule design and optimization, is diverse and dynamic.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
